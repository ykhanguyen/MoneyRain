# MoneyRain
Skills: jQuery, HTML, CSS, Node.JS, Socket.io
Time spent: ~7 hours.

This is a multiplayer game with chat box. 
Rule: the shooting bullet has to match the color of the raining coin to gain a point. For each incorrect match, 
you will get a point off.

Challenge I ran into:
This is my first time makes a OOP on JS. I was struggling to manage the status of each object such as collison and
location. Moreover, I have to detect the user input such as shooting or moving action at the same time with other objects.
